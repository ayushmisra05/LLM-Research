As prices decrease, the purchasing power of money increases, creating a deflationary environment.\\n\\n2. Keynesian Theory: According to this theory, a decrease in interest rates causes people to save less and spend more, leading to an increase in aggregate demand and a rise in prices. On the other hand, a decrease in interest rates leads to a decrease in spending and a decrease in prices, resulting in deflation.\\n\\n3. Fisher Effect: The Fisher effect suggests that a decrease in the nominal interest rate (the stated interest rate) leads to a decrease in the real interest rate (the interest rate adjusted for inflation). As the real interest rate decreases, borrowing becomes cheaper, leading to an increase in consumption and investment, which can ultimately lead to an increase in prices and inflation.\\n\\n4. The Velocity of Money: This theory suggests that a decrease in the velocity of money (the rate at which money changes hands in the economy) can lead to deflation.
